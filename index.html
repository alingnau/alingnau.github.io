        This workshop is part of the 33rd International Conference on Computers in Education (ICCE2025).

    <h1>The 1st Workshop on Assessments with Refute Problems</h1>
    <p>The purpose of this workshop is to initiate the development of best practices for formative and summative assessments using Refute Problems (Kumar, 2021; Agarwal et al., 2023). This workshop primarily targets faculty who teach introductory courses in programming, algorithms, and software engineering, but it is open to all faculty who see value in Refute Problems.</p>

    <h2>What is a Refute Problem?</h2>
    <p>A Refute Problem presents students with an incorrect but plausible solution to a given task. To solve such a problem, students must demonstrate a mismatch between the given solution and the task. In the context of programming courses, students are given buggy code for some tasks, and they must identify an input on which the code’s behaviour does not match the desired behaviour (as per the task).</p>

    <h2>Importance of Refute Problems in the Gen AI era</h2>
    <p>As Gen AI tools mature, they are being integrated into professional workflows e.g., software development. Software developers often spend more time on comprehending and critiquing code written by others rather than on writing code themselves (Tiarks, 2011). Therefore, it is unsurprising that experienced developers can rapidly critique AI-generated suggestions (Ziegler et al., 2022). For students, however, this form of “vibe coding” bypasses a crucial aspect of the learning process: the thoughtful consideration of both the problem and the generated solution. Agarwal et al. (2023) note that Refute Problems may help students develop the ability to critique AI-generated code. The importance of developing this ability has been highlighted by both faculty and software developers (Lau and Guo, 2023; Prather et al., 2025). The ACM/IEEE-CS/AAAI Task Force (2024) suggests in its CS2023 curriculum that “reading programs will see a sharpened focus and the idea of learning to program by writing, and reliance on learning syntax, will change towards learning to program by prompting, comprehending, verifying, editing, modifying, adapting, and testing code”.</p>

    <h2>Beyond Programming</h2>
    <p>Refute Problems can potentially be adapted to other disciplines where it is important for students to practice critiquing AI-generated artefacts. Thus, while we will largely focus on Refute Problems in the context of programming, we welcome faculty who teach other courses (including non-computing courses) where the ability of students to critique AI-generated artefacts is important.</p>

    <h2>Format of the workshop</h2>
    <p>This discussion-based workshop will be conducted in two parts.</p>

    <h3>Part A: Hands-on introduction to Refute Problems and Formative Assessment strategies.</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>[50 minutes]</strong> We will provide sample problems in a web-based environment where participants will gain hands-on experience with Refute Problems and the types of errors in student solutions. Participants will work on their laptops.</li>
        <li><strong>[70 minutes]</strong> We will solicit participation in a preliminary study aimed at understanding mechanisms for presenting formative feedback on errors. We will jointly reflect on these findings, and we will explore the potential for a multi-institutional study to validate effective feedback mechanisms.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Part B: Implementing Refute Problems [60 minutes].</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Selected participants who have previously experimented with Refute Problems or have worked on implementation aspects (e.g., auto-generating or auto-grading Refute Problems) will be invited to share their experiences/research and lead follow-up discussions.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>If you are interested in participating, please register for ICCE and fill out the following form until 15 September:</p>
